# MTA-Clickwarp
Adds a new way to teleport over short distances - using the mouse cursor. It works like this: the cursor is activated by pressing a button, then the desired position is selected with the mouse (the destination point is highlighted) and after clicking the left mouse button (configured), the character is teleported to this place. It is possible to teleport directly into the car to an empty space, for this you need to hold down the right mouse button and then press the teleportation button.
